# **Factory Design Pattern in Java**

### **Purpose:**
The **Factory Design Pattern** is a **creational** design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects without specifying their exact class. Instead of directly using the `new` keyword, we delegate the object creation to a factory method.

### **When to Use Factory Pattern?**
- When we have a **superclass** with multiple **subclasses**, and we want to **instantiate the appropriate subclass** dynamically.
- When the **object creation logic is complex** and should be separated from client code.
- When we **don‚Äôt want to expose the instantiation logic** to the client.

---

## **Implementation Steps**
1. **Create an interface (or abstract class)** defining a contract for objects.
2. **Create multiple concrete classes** implementing that interface.
3. **Create a Factory class** with a method that returns an instance based on input.
4. **Use the Factory class** instead of directly instantiating objects with `new`.

## **Example: Shape Factory**
```mermaid
    classDiagram
    class FactoryPatternDemo {
        +main(String[] args)
    }

    class ShapeFactory {
        +getShape(String shapeType) Shape
    }

    class Shape {
        <<interface>>
        +draw()
    }

    class Circle {
        +draw()
    }

    class Rectangle {
        +draw()
    }

    class Square {
        +draw()
    }

    FactoryPatternDemo --> ShapeFactory : Uses
    ShapeFactory --> Shape : Returns
    Shape <|-- Circle
    Shape <|-- Rectangle
    Shape <|-- Square

```

## **Advantages of Factory Pattern**
‚úÖ **Encapsulation**: Hides the object creation logic from the client.  
‚úÖ **Flexibility**: Easily add new object types without modifying existing code.  
‚úÖ **Loose Coupling**: The client doesn‚Äôt need to know which class it is using.  

## **Disadvantages of Factory Pattern**
‚ùå **Increases Complexity**: Adds an extra layer of abstraction.  
‚ùå **Performance Overhead**: In simple cases, using `new` directly is more efficient.  

---

## **Real-World Examples of Factory Pattern**
1. **Java Collections Framework**  
   - `List<String> list = ArrayListFactory.create();` (instead of `new ArrayList<>()`)
2. **Database Connection**  
   - `Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, password);`
3. **Logging Frameworks**  
   - `Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(YourClass.class);`

### **Conclusion**
The **Factory Pattern** is a powerful tool when working with multiple subclasses and object creation logic that can change frequently. It makes the code **more maintainable** and **scalable**.

## **üîç Differences & Similarities**
| Feature            | Factory Pattern | Strategy Pattern |
|--------------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Purpose**       | Centralized object creation | Allows runtime selection of behavior |
| **Focus**         | Encapsulates object creation | Encapsulates algorithms/behaviors |
| **When to Use?**  | When object creation is complex | When multiple strategies exist for a task |
| **Example**       | Coffee Shop (creates different types of coffee) | Payment System (chooses different payment methods) |
| **Flexibility**   | Easy to add new products | Easy to add new behaviors |
| **Design Principle** | Encapsulation, Abstraction | Open/Closed Principle |

### **Conclusion**
- If you **want to create objects** without exposing the creation logic ‚Üí **Use Factory Pattern**.  
- If you **want to switch between different behaviors dynamically** ‚Üí **Use Strategy Pattern**.  

üí° Think of **Factory** as **"which object to create?"**  
üí° Think of **Strategy** as **"which algorithm to use?"**
